# Introduction

Almost everyone in an industrialized society in the early 21st Century knows
how to use a computer; that is, how to use a device in which a computer's
operation defines the device's behavior.  Each of a desktop computer, a
point-of-sale terminal, a tablet, a cell phone, and even the occasional wrist
watch is a device with more computing power than the most advanced, room-sized
computers of the 1960s.  Computers are a part of daily life because they are
small, inexpensive, functional, rugged, and easy to use.

## Basic Usage of a Computer

While good design of the *sensory interface* between the computer and the user
is key to a device's ease of use, the interface can be useful only if there be
good *software* running in the computer.  The sensory interface includes

 - from the computer every *output* by which the user can sense the behavior of
   the device and

 - to the computer every *input* by which the user can stimulate a change in
   the device's output.

A computer must, in order to make a device easy to use, run a program or
programs that make the behavior of the interface easy for the user to
understand.  The programs that run on a computer comprise the computer's
software.  The software defines the behavior of the device.  By experimenting
with the sensory interface, the user can learn how the device behaves.  When
the user has learnt how profitably to take advantage of the device's behavior,
the user has mastered the *basic* usage of the device's computer.

## Advanced Usage of a Computer

The occasional computing device, such as one with a full, physical keyboard,
allows for more *advanced* usage, in which the user can modify the device's
behavior in a deep way.  In such advanced usage, the user writes new software,
so that the device itself might have its behavior fundamentally changed, or so
that new software is written for another device.  This advanced usage is deep
in that the degree to which the device's behavior can be changed is limited
only by the user's understanding of the device's operation and by the user's
speculative intellect.

Such advanced usage imposes certain requirements on the physical interface and
on the software already in the device.  In the earliest days of computing, in
the middle of the 20th Century, no already-running software would be used in
writing a new piece of software; the new software would be crafted, for
example, by manually flipping switches to load individual bits into a
computer's memory.  Even so late as the middle 1970s, some of the early
computer kits for home use still had manual switches for loading a program into
memory.  Since the late 1970s, though, new software has almost always been
written with the assistance of existing software already running in the
computer.  Since then, new software has usually been written as words in a
*computer language* typed on a keyboard directly into the computer's memory.

In the middle 1980s, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) was established.  Its
purpose is to produce software that can be freely distributed.  Almost all of
the FSF's early software was designed to facilitate the production of new
software.  The FSF's GNU project aims to make a complete system of software for
running a computer.  As of the present writing, the GNU system is still not
complete, but many of its core programs, along with free software from other
projects, do provide a complete system for writing new software.

In what follows, we shall introduce the reader to the advanced usage of a
computer.  The idea is to enable the reader to define a computer's behavior
just as he pleases, within the constraints of the computer's physical
capability.
